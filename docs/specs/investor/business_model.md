# MyMedic — Business Model

## 1. Overview
MyMedic monetizes the digitization of outpatient operations through a hybrid model combining:

1. SaaS subscription
2. payments revenue (optional)
3. usage-based revenue (WhatsApp)
4. enterprise modules (chains)
5. implementation + support (hospital phase)

This model matches the evolution of outpatient digitization worldwide and supports both SMB clinics and enterprise chains/hospitals.

## 2. Pricing Structure (Phase 1 — Clinics & Chains)

Pricing components:

### (A) Subscription (SaaS)
Charged per:

- clinic
- doctor
- branch

Common structure:

```
₹X / clinic / month
₹Y / doctor / month
```

### (B) Usage-based (WhatsApp)
Clinics pay for transactional WhatsApp messages:

- booking confirmations
- refunds
- reminders
- links
- receipts

Low friction, high utility, low churn.

### (C) Payments Take Rate (Optional)
On deposits + telepayments + balances

- optional for India
- strong expansion lever
- aligns revenue with clinic growth

Becomes meaningful at chain level due to volume.

### (D) Enterprise Modules (Chains)
Enterprise customers increasingly pay for:

- dashboards
- reconciliation
- multi-branch analytics
- role-based permissions
- centralized catalog/pricing
- procurement-friendly SLA

### (E) Support + Implementation (Later)
For hospitals:

- onboarding
- training
- data migration
- compliance documentation
- HIS integration

Not required for clinics initially.

---

## 3. Payment Model (PM3)
The PM3 hybrid payment model is strategically important because it monetizes the clinic’s most sensitive metric:

> **yield per slot**

Payment surfaces:

- deposits (procedures)
- prepaid (teleconsult)
- in-clinic balances
- follow-up packages

Take rates align with:

✔ higher utilization  
✔ lower cancellations  
✔ lower no-shows  
✔ higher LTV  

---

## 4. ARPC (Average Revenue Per Customer)

### Clinics (3–10 doctors)
Typical ARPC components:

```
Subscription:     ₹12,000 – ₹45,000 / month
WhatsApp:         ₹2,000 – ₹10,000 / month
Payments:         ₹0 – ₹8,000 / month
Enterprise:       N/A
```

### Chains (10–200+ branches)
ARPC becomes:

```
Subscription:     ₹3L – ₹1.2Cr / year
WhatsApp:         scale with volume
Payments:         scale with volume
Enterprise:       ₹3L – ₹30L / year
```

### Hospital OPD (Later Phase)
Hospital OPD procurement introduces:

```
Enterprise:       ₹15L – ₹2Cr / year
Implementation:   ₹5L – ₹50L one-time
Support:          ₹1.5L – ₹12L / year
```

## 5. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

CAC dynamics differ:

| Segment | Motion | CAC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo clinics | Self-serve | Low | churn high |
| SMB clinics | Assisted sales | Medium | wedge position |
| Chains | Field sales | High | ACV > CAC |
| Enterprise | Enterprise sales | Very High | OPD/HIS attach |

MyMedic focuses initially on the **SMB clinic + chain** middle where CAC:ACV ratio is most favorable.

---

## 6. Retention & Expansion Mechanics

Retention is driven by operational entanglement:

**Operational Lock-in**
- scheduling
- payments
- follow-ups
- portals

**Data Lock-in**
- patient records
- pricing configuration
- chain structures
- analytics

**Financial Lock-in**
- outstanding balances
- refunds
- ledgers
- reconciliation

Once chains depend on reconciliation reports + dashboards, churn becomes extremely low.

---

## 7. Revenue Levers (Phased)

### Phase 1 — Clinics
Primary:
- subscription
- WhatsApp usage

Optional:
- payments take rate

### Phase 2 — Chains
Primary:
- subscription (multi-branch)
- usage
- enterprise modules

Optional:
- payments
- analytics modules

### Phase 3 — Hospitals OPD
Primary:
- enterprise licensing
- implementation fees
- integration fees
- support SLAs

Optional:
- payments
- TPA/insurance billing

## 8. Margin Structure

Gross margins by stream:

| Stream | Gross Margin |
|---|---|
| Subscription | 80–90% |
| WhatsApp usage | 10–25% (pass-through heavy) |
| Payments | 30–70% (if take-rate) |
| Enterprise | 75–90% |
| Implementation | 40–70% |
| Support | 50–70% |

Overall margin mix becomes healthier as chains + enterprise ramp.

---

## 9. Upsell & Expansion Path

Expansion vectors include:

**Breadth**
- more branches per chain
- more doctors per branch
- new specialties

**Depth**
- teleconsult
- packages
- marketing funnels
- analytics
- reconciliation
- insurance/TPA (later)
- OPD modules
- HIS integrations

**Financial**
- payments take rate
- BNPL (cosmetic/aesthetic)
- EMI (cosmetic/dental/IVF)

BNPL in dentistry & aesthetics is emerging in India.

---

## 10. Defensibility & Switching Cost

Switching cost increases as:

1. scheduling configured
2. pricing configured
3. deposit flows adopted
4. patient portal activated
5. staff trained
6. chain dashboards deployed
7. reconciliation + ledgers integrated

This is classic workflow > financial > data entanglement.

---

## 11. Network Effects (Soft)

Soft network effects via:

- doctor/patient retention
- referral acquisition
- follow-up capture
- teleconsult reactivation
- family bookings

Across chains, data compounds into:

- pricing optimization
- utilization optimization
- specialization profitability
- city-level demand mapping

These insights differentiate MyMedic over time.
