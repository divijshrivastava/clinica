# MyMedic — Metrics & Measurement Framework

## 1. Why Metrics Matter
Outpatient healthcare is driven by **operational performance** more than clinical or inpatient systems. MyMedic improves the **unit economics of visits**, so we measure:

> **Utilization → Yield → Retention**

These dimensions align with both clinic owners and investors.

---

## 2. Core Metric Pillars

We track 8 categories of metrics:

1. **Demand Metrics**
2. **Conversion Metrics**
3. **Slot Utilization Metrics**
4. **Yield Metrics**
5. **Payment Metrics**
6. **Retention Metrics**
7. **Chain Operational Metrics**
8. **Financial Metrics**

These map to Product + Ops + Finance + Investor audiences.

## 3. Demand Metrics (Lead → Booking)

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Leads | inbound patient intents |
| Bookings | confirmed appointments |
| Booking Source Mix | Phone / Portal / Referral / Walk-in |
| CAC per Consultation | cost to acquire consultation |

Portal adoption increases demand capture efficiency.

---

## 4. Conversion Metrics (Booking → Visit)

Key bottleneck for clinics.

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| Show-Up Rate | arrived / booked |
| Cancellation Rate | cancelled / booked |
| Reschedule Rate | rescheduled / booked |
| No-Show Rate | no-shows / booked |

PM3 (deposits) increases show-up rates.

---

## 5. Slot Utilization Metrics

Scheduling is the wedge, so this layer is critical.

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| Slot Utilization | slots filled / slots available |
| Doctor Utilization | hours booked / hours available |
| Staff Throughput | visits handled / staff hour |
| Multi-Branch Utilization | utilization variance across branches |

Chains care deeply about multi-branch variance.

---

## 6. Yield Metrics (Revenue per Slot)

Yield captures monetization intensity.

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| Gross Yield per Slot | revenue / slots |
| Deposit Capture Rate | deposits / scheduled procedures |
| Tele Prepay Rate | tele prepaid / tele visits |
| Deposit Recovery | balance collected / total billed |

These are directly impacted by MyMedic workflows.

---

## 7. Payment Metrics

Payment layer becomes financial lock-in.

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| Deposit Rate | deposit visits / total visits |
| Refund Rate | refunds / deposits |
| Balance Collection Rate | balances paid / balances owed |
| Leakage | unpaid balances / total owed |
| Settlement Time | avg time to close visit financially |

Chains will not churn if reconciliation locks in.

---

## 8. Retention Metrics (Patient-Facing)

Retention drives patient LTV.

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Follow-Up Capture Rate | follow-up visits completed |
| Repeat Visit Rate | percentage returning |
| Procedure Conversion | consult → procedure rate |
| Patient NPS | subjective quality metric |
| Referral Rate | referrals / patients |

Follow-ups are high-value in dental, derm, oncology.

---

## 9. Chain Operational Metrics (Enterprise)

Enterprise deal success depends here.

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Pricing Compliance | adherence to catalog pricing |
| Branch Performance | rev & utilization by branch |
| Doctor Performance | utilization & yield by doctor |
| Staff Performance | throughput & cancellation handling |
| City Performance | geo-level yield |
| Booking Source Mix | phone vs portal vs referral |

Chains optimize staffing through these metrics.

---

## 10. Financial Metrics (Investor-Facing)

Investor view aligns with SaaS + fintech hybrids.

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| ARPC | average revenue per customer |
| ARPU | average revenue per user |
| LTV | long-term clinic value |
| CAC | acquisition cost |
| CAC Recovery | months to recover CAC |
| NRR | net revenue retention |
| Logo Churn | clinic churn |
| Dollar Churn | revenue churn |
| Gross Margin | revenue - COGS |
| Take Rate | payments margin |
| Usage Margin | WhatsApp margin |

Hybrid SaaS + payments can produce attractive NRR.

---

## 11. Metrics by Phase

| Phase | Key Metrics |
|---|---|
| Clinics | utilization, yield, leakage |
| Chains | multi-branch variance, reconciliation |
| Hospital OPD | visit throughput, admission conversion |
| HIS | claim cycle, TPA clearance, LOS |

Clinics adopt because of **yield + leakage**.  
Chains adopt because of **variance + reconciliation**.

---

## 12. North Star Metric

For MyMedic the North Star metric is:

> **Revenue Yield per Doctor**

Secondary North Star:

> **Slot Utilization**

These two metrics correlate tightly with:

- clinic profitability
- patient throughput
- chain performance

Few competitors optimize for yield; MyMedic does.

---

## 13. Retention Flywheel

Retention flywheel emerges when:

```
better scheduling
→ higher utilization
→ higher yield
→ more follow-ups
→ higher LTV
→ more branch expansion
→ chain standardization
→ data moat
```

This matches patterns seen in high-margin elective segments.

---

## 14. Investor Efficiency Metrics

Hybrid fintech/SaaS efficiency metrics:

- CAC:ACV ratio
- payback period
- NRR
- dollar retention
- margin expansion
- upsell expansion
- chain attach rate
- OPD attach rate (later)

These make MyMedic attractive for growth investors.

---

## 15. Moat Metrics (Emerging)

Moats form through:

**Data Moat**
- pricing
- conversion
- cancellation
- utilization curves

**Workflow Moat**
- payments
- portals
- reconciliation
- chain + ops

**Financial Moat**
- deposits
- balances
- refunds

Once chains depend on reconciliation + variance dashboards, switching cost becomes high.
