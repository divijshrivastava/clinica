# MyMedic — Investor Overview

## 1. Product Summary
MyMedic is a doctor-first, semi-integrated patient management platform purpose-built for clinics and multi-branch chains in India.

The platform manages the complete outpatient lifecycle:

- time-slot scheduling (procedures + consults)
- patient portal (hybrid booking)
- doctor mobile calendar
- WhatsApp confirmations + reminders
- hybrid payments (PM3: deposit + prepaid + in-clinic)
- pricing + packages
- follow-ups
- clinical workflows
- chain-level analytics

MyMedic sits between consumer booking and full hospital HIS and is designed to expand into ADT/Insurance/TPA as we scale.

## 2. Problem
Outpatient care for clinics/centers is still run on:

- phone calls
- WhatsApp threads
- reception registers
- Excel sheets
- fragmented billing
- siloed portals
- staff intuition

This leads to:

**Clinical problems**
- no-show rates of 15–40%
- follow-up adherence <30%
- poor patient experience

**Operational problems**
- no visibility across branches
- scheduling conflicts
- staff throughput bottlenecks
- unpredictable procedure load

**Financial problems**
- revenue leakage
- no deposit enforcement
- delayed payments
- low yield per slot
- zero forecasting

---

## 3. Solution
MyMedic increases throughput & revenue by digitizing outpatient operations:

- portal → increases booking conversion
- WhatsApp → reduces no-shows
- deposits → reduces cancellations
- follow-ups → increases LTV
- chain dashboards → optimize staffing
- doctor mobile → increases utilization

MyMedic acts as the **nerve layer** of clinic operations.

## 4. Target Customer
Phase 1 target:

**Cash-pay clinics & chains**
- dental
- aesthetics / medspa
- dermatology
- ophthalmology
- IVF consult
- oncology follow-up

These categories have:

- high procedure margins
- standardized SKUs
- repeat visits
- doctor-dependent utilization
- willingness to prepay/deposit
- brand competition

---

## 5. Wedge
Industry software tends to be:

- too generic (appointment tools)
- too heavy (full HIS)
- too patient-first (aggregators)
- too billing-first (RCM tools)

MyMedic wedges in as:

> **doctor-first + chain-ready + payment-native**

---

## 6. Expansion Path
Once the wedge is secured, expand outwards:

1. clinics → chains
2. chains → hospital OPD
3. OPD → TPA + Insurance
4. day-procedures → admission
5. admission → OT + billing
6. billing → full HIS

This path has been validated internationally (SimplePractice → Tele → RCM, NexHealth → Chain → EHR integrations)

---

## 7. Why Now
India outpatient healthcare is undergoing:

- consumerization of care
- procedure-based pricing
- digital payments adoption
- clinic chain formation
- doctor mobile usage
- WhatsApp business usage
- insurance expansion

The infrastructure layer is finally ready.

**Data**
- scheduling data
- revenue data
- conversion funnels

**Expansion**
