# MyMedic — Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

## 1. GTM Overview
MyMedic’s GTM is sequenced to match buyer sophistication and operational readiness in outpatient care:

> **Clinics → Chains → Hospital OPD**

For each segment, we design:

- acquisition motion
- onboarding motion
- activation motion
- expansion motion
- retention motion

---

## 2. ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

### Phase 1 ICP (Clinics)
- 3–10 doctors
- procedure-heavy
- elective/cash-pay
- moderate OPD traffic
- staffed reception
- WhatsApp-first coordination

Specialties include:

- dental
- dermatology
- aesthetics/medspa
- ophthalmology consult
- IVF consult
- oncology follow-up

### Phase 2 ICP (Chains)
- 10+ branches
- central finance + ops
- standardized pricing/SOPs
- proactive marketing budgets
- multi-city expansion plan
- procurement process exists

---

## 3. Buyer Personas

**A. Business Owner / Director**
- cares about revenue, leakage, utilization, expansion

**B. Doctor (Medical Director)**
- cares about scheduling, workflow, clinical throughput

**C. Operations Manager**
- cares about staffing, cancellations, no-shows, dashboards

**D. Finance**
- cares about deposits, balances, reconciliation, refunds

**E. Patient**
- cares about convenience, transparency, communication

MyMedic satisfies all 5 without heavy HIS-style onboarding.

---

## 4. Acquisition Channels

Primary acquisition channels:

**(1) Direct Sales**
- responsible for chain + clinic mid-market
- ROI arguments resonate strongly here

**(2) Partner Clinics**
- dentists, derm, medspa, IVF centers refer by specialty
- high cross-specialty trust

**(3) Vertical KOLs**
- doctors trust peer recommendations
- high-signal endorsements

**(4) WhatsApp Business**
- frictionless patient channel integrates tightly into workflow

**(5) Clinical OEM Partnerships (Later)**
with:
- dental implants
- medspa equipment
- clinic supply chains

---

## 5. Activation Levers

Activation focuses on measurable clinic outcomes:

**(A) Reduced No-Shows**
via:
- deposit enforcement
- WhatsApp reminders
- portal confirmations

**(B) Higher Utilization**
via:
- calendar optimization
- follow-up capture
- teleconsult conversion

**(C) Higher Yield**
via:
- hybrid payments (PM3)
- pricing structuring
- branch/doctor modifiers

**(D) Reduced Leakage**
via:
- balance collection workflows
- billing & reconciliation
- refund logic

Clinics adopt when they **feel** revenue & throughput gains inside 30–45 days.

---

## 6. Sales Motion

Sales motion evolves with ICP:

| ICP | Motion | Sales Cycle | ACV |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo | Self-Serve | 1–7 days | Low |
| Clinic | Sales + Assist | 7–21 days | Medium |
| Chain | Full Sales | 30–90 days | High |
| Hospital OPD | Enterprise | 120–240 days | Very High |

MyMedic starts at Clinic/Chain level where CAC:ACV is favorable.

---

## 7. Onboarding Motion

Onboarding designed for clinic time constraints:

```
Self-Serve + Assisted + White-Glove for Chains
```

Key principle:

> **Activation = First Patient + First Payment**

Staff must be able to:
1. schedule visit
2. confirm deposit
3. collect balance

...without reading a manual.

---

## 8. Pricing Strategy

Pricing is **hybrid SaaS + usage + payments**:

- per-clinic subscription
- per-doctor pricing
- WhatsApp usage
- payments take rate (optional)
- enterprise modules (chains)
- implementation fees (hospital phase)

Hybrid pricing creates:

- margin flexibility
- CAC recovery optionality
- expansion revenue

---

## 9. Retention Strategy

Retention drivers:

- utilization lock-in
- financial flows (deposits, balances)
- staff workflow integration
- clinical workflows
- patient portal data
- chain reporting

The system becomes harder to rip out once:

1. prices are configured
2. doctors depend on schedule
3. finance depends on reconciliation
4. chain depends on dashboards

---

## 10. Expansion Strategy

Expansion vectors:

**Horizontal Expansion**
- additional clinics in same chain
- new specialties
- new cities

**Vertical Expansion**
- teleconsult
- payments
- packages
- marketing funnels
- analytics
- insurance/TPA (Phase 2+)
- hospital OPD (Phase 3+)

---

## 11. Land-and-Expand Framework

MyMedic uses:

> **Land with scheduling, expand into payments → portal → dashboards → hospital**

Sequence:

1. Land — scheduling
2. Expand — payments
3. Expand — portal
4. Expand — follow-ups
5. Expand — teleconsult
6. Expand — chain dashboards
7. Expansion — financial integrations
8. Expansion — OPD modules
9. Expansion — HIS integrations

Similar ramp has proven durable in other markets.

---

## 12. International Expansion

Once India clinic/chain wedge is successful:

- MENA (KSA + UAE) outpatient has similar dynamics
- SEA (ID, VN, PH) also procedure-oriented
- LatAm private clinics mirror chain formation

Market dynamics favor emerging outpatient digitization.
