# MyMedic — Market Landscape

## 1. Market Definition
MyMedic operates in the outpatient clinical care market across:

- diagnostics
- consultations
- procedures
- follow-ups

This represents the majority of healthcare volume in India and is growing faster than inpatient volumes due to:

- chronic disease prevalence
- elective procedures
- preventive care
- cosmetic/aesthetic demand
- telehealth adoption

---

## 2. Market Segmentation
We segment the market as:

### (A) Solo Clinics
- 1–2 doctors
- local catchment area
- low tech adoption
- low ARPC
- high owner involvement

Examples: independent dental clinics, dermatologist practices.

### (B) Multi-Doctor Clinics
- 3–10 doctors
- more procedures
- staff-managed reception
- appointment backlogs
- moderate revenue leakage
- beginning to digitize

Examples: dermatology, ophthalmology, IVF consult centers.

### (C) Clinic Chains
- 10–200 branches
- standardized procedures & pricing
- professional management layer
- aggressive growth goals
- multi-city expansion
- require dashboards + payments + reporting

Examples: dental chains, cosmetic chains, IVF chains, oncology follow-up programs.

### (D) Hospital Outpatient Departments (OPD)
- large volumes
- specialty run clinics inside hospitals
- doctor-led utilization
- admission conversion funnels
- interface to HIS required

These will be Phase 2 for MyMedic.

## 3. Outpatient vs Inpatient Economics

| Dimension | Outpatient | Inpatient |
|---|---|---|
| Volume | Very High | Low |
| Margins | Moderate–High | High |
| Digital Adoption | Early | Mature |
| Staff Complexity | Low | High |
| Billing Complexity | Low–Medium | Very High |
| Scheduling | Critical | Critical |
| Payments | Direct/Hybrid | Insurance/TPA |
| Integration Need | Medium | High |
| Procurement Complexity | Low | High |

Outpatient is the **entry point** for software vendors globally due to lower procurement friction and faster sales cycles.

## 4. Unit of Value: The "Slot"
Clinics and chains monetize based on **slots filled**, not beds.

Slot economics include:

- doctor utilization
- no-shows
- cancellations
- follow-up capture
- conversion to procedures

Tools that improve slot economics drive revenue directly.

## 5. Growth Drivers (India 2024–2032)

**Consumer drivers**
- elective spending up
- dental & cosmetic demand
- preventive health consciousness
- telehealth normalization
- digital payments

**Provider drivers**
- clinic chain formation
- consolidation of specialties
- expansion to tier-2/3 cities
- marketing + CAC pressure
- need for standardization

**Infrastructure drivers**
- UPI + payment rails
- WhatsApp Business API
- Aadhaar/KYC rails
- e-invoicing mandates (optional)
- digital health stack & NDHM

## 6. Market Size (Top-Down)

India Outpatient Market (2023 estimates):

- Total outpatient spending: **~$55B–65B**
- Cash-pay portion: **~$35B–45B**
- Addressable private clinics: **>800,000**
- Chains: **~900–1,200**
- Hospital OPDs: **~7,000–10,000**

Addressable SaaS TAM (software + payments):

- Clinic SaaS spend: **$2–3B**
- Payments take rate potential: **$0.4–0.8B**
- Insurance/TPA processing: **$1–2B**
- Future HIS integration: **$3–5B**

---

## 7. Market Size (Bottom-Up)

We model based on chain adoption:

```
# clinics_per_chain × # chains × ARPC × penetration
```

Example (dental):

```
(12 avg clinics/chain)
× (600 chains)
× ($250/mo ARPC)
= ~$21.6M annual potential
```

Then add:

- dermatology
- ophthalmology
- IVF consult
- oncology follow-up
- multispecialty chains

Total clinic-chain TAM (software-only):

> **~$80M–120M / year in India**

Adding payments (PM3 hybrid):

Assuming 10–30 bps net take on procedure volume:

- Procedure volume: **~$8–12B**
- Take @ 15 bps: **~$120–180M**

Statements match global analogs (SimplePractice, NexHealth, Phreesia).

## 8. Why Chains Matter (Strategic Insight)

Chains create:

- standardization of workflows
- multi-branch operations
- centralized marketing
- centralized finance
- centralized procurement

This allows:

- faster sales cycles
- higher ACV
- lower support cost per site
- stronger lock-in
- repeatable GTM motion

Chains are the **scaling vehicle** for MyMedic.

---

## 9. Competitive Landscape

Categories:

**(1) Appointment Tools**
- good for bookings
- bad for clinical workflows
- no payments integration
- no chain support

**(2) Practice Management**
- clinic-centric
- moderate scheduling
- weak patient portal
- weak chain support

**(3) Hospital HIS**
- overbuilt for clinics
- complex billing
- poor UX
- no patient-first flows

**(4) Patient Aggregators**
- demand gen
- take rate model
- auction dynamics
- patient-first, not doctor-first

**(5) Horizontal SaaS**
- Calendly/Zoho
- weak healthcare nuances

MyMedic sits between categories to create a wedge:

> **doctor-first + chain-ready + payment-native + scheduling-intensive**

---

## 10. Timing
The outpatient digital curve in India is at the “stack building” phase similar to where US clinics were in 2012–2015.

India has leapfrogged in:

- WhatsApp usage
- UPI payments
- mobile-first doctor workflows

Infrastructure tailwinds align with MyMedic’s value proposition today.
