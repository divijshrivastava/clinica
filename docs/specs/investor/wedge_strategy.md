# MyMedic — Wedge Strategy

## 1. Wedge Definition
A wedge is the initial product + market configuration that allows a startup to gain traction in a complex market and then expand into larger surface areas.

MyMedic’s wedge:

> **Clinics → Chains via Scheduling + Payments + Portal**

This wedge is deliberately chosen because it impacts:

- utilization (doctor time)
- yield (revenue per slot)
- conversion (bookings → visits)
- leakage (refunds + cancellations)
- follow-ups (LTV)
- CAC (via portal + WhatsApp)
- staff throughput
- chain visibility

These are the levers clinics care about most.

---

## 2. Why Scheduling is the Wedge
In outpatient care, scheduling is the **primitive unit of value**:

- doctors monetize their time through slots
- clinics scale through branches & schedules
- patients consume through appointments
- chains optimize utilization & yield

Fixing scheduling unlocks:

✔ portal (booking)  
✔ staff (coordination)  
✔ doctor mobile (utilization)  
✔ payments (yield)  
✔ analytics (visibility)  
✔ follow-ups (LTV)  
✔ tele (conversion)  

This aligns with global patterns (NexHealth, SimplePractice, Phreesia).

## 3. Why Payments Are the Second Lever
Clinics lose money through:

- cancellations
- no-shows
- last-minute reschedules
- payment leakage
- delayed balances

Deposits + pre-pay + balances create:

- financial predictability
- improved show-up rate
- workflow lock-in
- measurable conversion

PM3 hybrid (prepay+dep+in-clinic) is ideal for India outpatient due to diverse visit types.

---

## 4. Why Chains Are the Scaling Vehicle
Chains care about:

- standardization
- dashboards
- payments
- pricing
- procurement
- brand consistency
- cross-branch staffing
- multi-city scaling

Once a chain adopts MyMedic:

- the switching cost increases
- the operational dependencies deepen
- the data compounding begins

Chains let MyMedic compress CAC:

```
# doctors onboarded / sales rep
```

---

## 5. Why Portals Drive Patient Pull
Patient portals do two things simultaneously:

1. Convert demand without staff friction  
2. Create clinical & financial lock-in  
   (because patients track visits, balances, receipts)

WhatsApp closes the loop on:

- booking
- reminders
- payments
- follow-ups

These are high-sensitivity customer success touchpoints.

## 6. Sequencing the Wedge

The wedge expands in sequenced layers:

### **Layer 1: Scheduling**
(doctor time → slots)

### **Layer 2: Payments**
(deposits → prepay → balances)

### **Layer 3: Portal**
(self-serve booking → retention)

### **Layer 4: Multi-Branch Ops**
(utilization → yield → staffing)

### **Layer 5: Tele + Follow-ups**
(LTV → adherence → referral loops)

### **Layer 6: Reporting + Dashboards**
(financial + operational metrics)

### **Layer 7: Integrations**
(billing → insurance → HIS → TPA)

This sequencing matches clinic maturity curves.

---

## 7. Differentiation vs Aggregators
Aggregators (e.g., Practo consumer) own the **demand** surface but not the **scheduling/payments** surface.

MyMedic owns:

- schedule → utilization → yield → margin

These are **supply-side primitives**.

Supply side is ultimately more defensible than consumer demand aggregation in healthcare.

---

## 8. Differentiation vs HIS
Hospital HIS solutions assume:

- admission
- inpatient billing
- materials management
- insurance
- OT
- lab/RIS
- PACS
- TPA

Clinics do not need this overhead.

MyMedic bridges the gap by creating an **Outpatient OS** that can later integrate into HIS on the hospital side.

---

## 9. Data Moat Strategy
Three moats compound over time:

**Moat 1 — Operational**
- fills slots
- reduces leakage
- increases revenue yield

**Moat 2 — Behavioral**
- patient follow-up data
- doctor utilization curves
- slot pricing sensitivity
- cancellation patterns

**Moat 3 — Financial**
- deposit balances
- outstanding balances
- payment flows
- chain-level P&L data

These moats are not easily portable between systems.

---

## 10. Final Wedge Expression

> **Scheduling → Payments → Portal → Chains → OPD → HIS**

This wedge gives MyMedic an on-ramp into hospitals without fighting incumbents head-on.
